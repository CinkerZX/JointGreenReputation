%% This function is to update the plan for nodes who failed to build new connection
% !!!
% If adding neighbors fail, then need to either cutoff with the neighbor
% who has the lowest JR, or trans
% Alg: Already trans? (if the focal already trans, but add fail, then there must be neighbors with low JR)
%        Y: Cutoff with lowest neighbor
%        N: Has neighbor? (first consider to cutting off, unless the focal is the loest)
%               N: trans (I have no neighbors, I haven't trans)
%               Y: is the JR of the focal lower than all neighbors?
%                        Y: trans
%                        N: cut off with the lowest neighbor
