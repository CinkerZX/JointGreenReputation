- the tolerance is power law distributed, and the lower_bound is 0.05, upper_bound is 0.1

> Changes the threshould of cutting the edge with previous collaborator (threshold) from ~~0.05~~ to 0.1

## strategyFirstPlan2

    - tolerance  % if below the average of the industry this much

## helperFindLowestJRNeighbor

    - global threshold
    - abs(minNeighborJR - currentNodeJR) > threashold
